## Overview

Simultaneous provisioning of multiple benefits – multifunctionality – in vegetated green infrastructure (GI) is not guaranteed yet may be achieved by planning two critical components of GI: the spatial placement of GI and the traits of the plant species used to vegetate GI. This repository provides code for the Green Infrastructure Space and Traits (GIST) model, a planning tool for evaluating and maximizing GI multifunctionality based on optimizing both site selection and plant traits in GI design to promote urban planning with higher sustainability and benefits to humans. GIST involves identifying priority areas for GI placement and using plant species with traits that maximize benefits and multifunctionality in priority areas.

## Instructions 
To run the code as is, you first need to download the datafrom two sources: [iecolab GIST data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BvBREOt57L6hZyJWSgV1EGzO83VcNsJw) and [Philadelphia Water Department GI data](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?q=green+infrastructure). The data are stored as zip files and will need to be extracted.

## Feedback and Questions
* This repository is a work in progress and is distributed as is, but we welcome feedback.

* Please contact Tyler Tran and Matt Helmus for any questions about how to run the code and Jocelyn Behm for any collaboration requests. 

* If you you've found a bug, open an issue (tagged 'bug') that contains a  [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve "How to make a great reproducible example?"). We'll try and get back to you quickly. If you are able to solve the bug on your own, please post the correction.

* If you have a feature request, open an issue (tagged 'enhancement') to discuss it. We're much more likely to be able to do it if you can be clear and concise about what you want, and if you have already written some code that you would like to merge. If you are requesting a complicated analysis technique that is not available, then consider bringing one of the authors of the individual code repositories on as a collaborator.
